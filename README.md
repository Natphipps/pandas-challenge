module 4 pandas challenge


For this challenge, I used some in-class activities from module 4 to help me with syntax for my code. I used an outside website called geeksforgeeks.org to find the .nunique functon. My tutor Saad Khan helped guide me through parts of the challenge, including the school summary section, and helped me understand how to use the .groupby function for the scores by grade section, and .pd.cut function for the scores by spending section.
